            ALL i wanted to say is <br>
            Alliances:
            Europe was divided into two powerful groups <br>
            Triple Alliance:Germany, Austria-Hungry, Itely <br>
            Triple Entente: Britian ,France, Russia <br>
            If one nation was attacked, others were bound to join-- turning a small confict into a world war.
            <br> Imerialism:
            Major European powers fought for colonies in Africa and Asia.
            This rivalry increased hostility and mistrust.
            <br> Nationalism:
            Countries wanted to prove their power and superiority.
            <br> Small nations like Serbia wanted independence from empires like Austria-Hungary.
            <br>Immediate Cause(Trigger Event):
            <br>Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo by a Serbian nationalist.
            <br>Austria-Hungry declared war on Serbia ,leading to a chain reaction among allied countries.
